When you hover over a link, you are shown the scipture reference in a popup. Clicking the link takes you to the associated scripture passage.\r\n\r\nAll of this is made possible by using the free RefTagger tool from Logos Bible Software.\r\n\r\n[![Action Shot](https://raw.github.com/westhomas/scripture-tagger/master/images/screen_shot_1.png)](https://raw.github.com/westhomas/scripture-tagger/master/images/screen_shot_1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###Installation\r\n\r\nGo to the [Google Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scripture-tagger/bjdodjhgmhfknagondkknocjpdchkhcn) and click \"Add To Chrome\".\r\n\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\n\r\nTo get the code [View On GitHub](https://github.com/westhomas/scripture-tagger).
