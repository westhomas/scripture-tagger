#About Scripture Tagger

In the normal course of reading theological works, you are required to manually lookup each scripture reference using Google or some other Bible Software or website.

This is a simple Chrome Extension which turns scripture references on a webpage into links. When you hover over a link, you are shown the scipture reference in a popup. Clicking the link takes you to the associated scripture passage.

All of this is made possible by using the free Reftagger tool from Logos Bible Software.
